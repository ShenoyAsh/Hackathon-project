# 🌱 GreenPulse – Smart Sustainability Monitoring Platform

GreenPulse is a smart sustainability monitoring platform that collects, processes, and visualizes environmental data to help individuals and organizations make greener, data-driven decisions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Environmental sustainability is often discussed, but actionable and easy-to-understand data is rarely accessible in one place. GreenPulse bridges this gap by transforming sustainability-related data into meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard.

This project was **independently developed and implemented** for the CodeSpring Online Hackathon. While the core concept originated from a previous hackathon idea, the entire implementation, restructuring, and refinement were carried out individually for this submission.
